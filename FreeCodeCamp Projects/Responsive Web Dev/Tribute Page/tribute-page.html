      Max Ehrmann (1872-1945) was a scholar and poet, born in Terre Haute,
      Indiana on September 16, 1872. He was the youngest of five children of
      German immigrants. He graduated from DePauw University in Greencastle,
      Indiana in 1894, and then studied law and philosophy at Harvard
      University. After being a lawyer for several years, Ehrmann went to work
      in his family’s business. After 10 years in the business world, Ehrmann
      retired so he could devote all his time to literary work. Toward the end
      of his life, during an interview, he told a writer, “At DePauw, I
      contracted a disease which I have never shaken off. The disease was
      Idealism. I took it to Harvard with me where I studied philosophy. Because
      of it I did the thing in life I wanted to do—writing.”
